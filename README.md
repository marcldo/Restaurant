# Restaurant

Alongside my team (Marc Felizardo and Poonam Halani), we created an app using ;
HTML
BOOTSTRAP
JAVASCRIPT
jQuery
Node js
Express
...to make reseravtions for our restaurant. 
There are a total of 5 tables available, so any additional reservations will go in the "wait list".

Things to improve
________________
-Add validation on the make reservations page
-make is visually more appealing
